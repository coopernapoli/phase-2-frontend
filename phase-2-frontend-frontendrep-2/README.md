This application works for an individual looking to sell training programs through an interactive website.  The Home, Contact, About, and Generate Workout tabs route clients through this single page application to observe and interact with different components.  The stars of the show here include the About and Generate Workout components, where the user may submit an application to train, and post the results of a randomized workout to a database.  This app serves as a basic functionality for a future project I will work on for a live gym, and it served to teach me more about fetching and posting data in REACT, with added complexities using JavaScript to deliver a few novel components.
